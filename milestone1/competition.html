        <h2>Competition</h2>
        <h4>What the competition is doing right.</h4>
        <p>Techincally, nothing. As far as I've searched, I haven't found a website that does what this website will do. However, <a href="https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/">Satisfactory Wiki</a> and <a href="https://satisfactory-calculator.com/">Satisfactory Calculator</a> combined can allow you to more easily plan your own factories.</p>
        <p>What these websites are doing well is</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keeping information up to date</li>
            <li>Linking to internal sources for information on terminology and other info</li>
            <li>Following a similar visual style to the game itself</li>
        </ul>    
        <h4>What the competition is doing wrong.</h4>
        <p>The websites listed before are</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Not allowing design <em>models</em> to be uploaded</li>
            <li>Not keeping text organized across the navigation bar and other items are messy</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>How I can do it better.</h4>
        <p>I will</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the same themes similar to the game, but keep everything organized and intuitive</li>
            <li>Upload direct model diagrams onto the website, not blueprints or a clunky calculator (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3187030/Satisfactory_Modeler/">Satisfactory Modeler</a> can handle that)</li>
        </ul>
