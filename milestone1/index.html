        <h2>Website Summary</h2>
        <h4>What content will the site contain?</h4>
        <p>
            The site will contain different factory designs for the game, Satisfactory. These designs may be the cheapest,
            most energy-efficient, or most capable factories for the respective product.
        </p>
        <h4>Where will you get all of the content for your site?</h4>
        <p>
            The content will primarily be images of models I create in an app called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3187030/Satisfactory_Modeler/">Satisfactory Modeler</a>
        </p>
        <h4>Why should users care about the focus of the site?</h4>
        <p>
            Users who are particularly lazy or who do not want to put in the time to plan a factory can come to this
            website to easily find a plan to create in game.
        </p>
        <h4>Why should a site be built for this?</h4>
        <p>
            A site should be built for this to make it easier for those who've played the game through before or are
            confused on factory creation methods to reference when designing or implementing their own factories in
            game. This site would effectively bypass the tedious planning stage of an individual factory.
        </p>
        <h4>What would you like users to do at your site?</h4>
        <p>
            I would like users to be able to read about design techniques and also sort pre-made designs by a certain
            criteria.
        </p>
        <h4>What is the goal of this site?</h4>
        <p>
            The goal of this site is to provide an accessible database for any users who are struggling with making
            efficient factories in Satisfactory.
